title: Setup Steps
---

Lately I was struggling to find free time for the blog. I heard about
GitHub pages but never looked at the whole process. 
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) caught my eye. 

The beauty of GitHub pages is that you write a content in Markdown, push post file
 to the repository and rest is taken care by GitHub and Jekyll. 
 I decide to give it a try to simplify my blogging process.

Here are the steps i followed:
1. Setup Jekyll locally to test the process: [Install Jekyll on Windows](http://chrismeserole.com/coding/install-ruby-rails-jekyll-on-windows/)
{% highlight text %}
cd C:/Railsinstaller 
gem install github-pages
{% endhighlight %}

2. Add [Python](https://www.python.org/) for highlighting source code I.e. pygments
Please note for `pygments` to work you need install python 2.7 and it to path `c:\Python;`

3. I used Lanyon theme : [Poole, Hyde, Lanyon themes](http://getpoole.com/) 

4. Write the post in R Markdown, for example using R Studio and convert to Jekyll Markdown
using [KnitPost ](https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/jfisher-usgs.github.com/blob/master/Rmd/2012-07-03-knitr-jekyll.Rmd)

To create Jekyll site:
{% highlight text %}
jekyll serve --watch
{% endhighlight %}
and browse to http://localhost:4000/

Once you happy with results, commit your changes to repository and check your site.
{% highlight text %}
 git add .
 git commit -m"new post"
 git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}


I did not found a feature in Markdown to open a link in new window, but following question / answer solves the problem:
[Open links in the new window](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4425198/markdown-target-blank)
{% highlight javascript %}
var links = document.links;

for (var i = 0, linksLength = links.length; i < linksLength; i++) {
   if (links[i].hostname != window.location.hostname) {
       links[i].target = '_blank';
   } 
}

If you're using jQuery it's a tad simpler...

$(document.links).filter(function() {
    return this.hostname != window.location.hostname;
}).attr('target', '_blank');
{% endhighlight %}
    

    
R Blogs that are using Jeykill and GitHub pages:
----
* [Jason C Fisher's Blog](http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/r/2012/07/03/knitr-jekyll/)
  - [Jason C Fisher at GitHub](https://github.com/jfisher-usgs/jfisher-usgs.github.com)
* [Fellgernon Bit's Blog](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2013/11/09/new-Fellgernon-Bit-setup-in-Github/)

Additionally
----
Running and publishing results / reports of automated stadies / strategies
becomes very simple. for example each before market open


* run strategy back-test create report / list of trades
* push final Markdown file with details to GitHub
The report will automatically be published.

This process can be sceduled and 100% automatic.
