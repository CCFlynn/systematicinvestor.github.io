I use following tools extensively to speed up my work flow:
---


* [Desktops - virtual destop(s) manger](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881)
* [Process Explorer - super taks manager](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx)
also if you have a looked file and wondering what process is using it
Go to Find -> Find Handle or DLL.
In the "Handle or DLL substring:" text box, type the path to the file
* [WinSplit Revolution - easily resize windows with keyboard shortcuts](http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/winsplit_revolution.html)
