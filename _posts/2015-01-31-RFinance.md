I submitted following abstract for the upcoming [R/Finance 2015](http://www.rinfinance.com/)
conference. The [R/Finance 2015](http://www.rinfinance.com/)conference will be held 
on May 29 and 30, 2015 in Chicago, IL, USA.



Follow the Leader - the application of time-lag series analysis to discover leaders in S&P 500.
---

**Keywords**: time series correlation, leader discovery

The discovery of lead / lag relationships in the time series data can
improve strategy returns, reduce risk exposure, and simplify re-balancing process.
The inference process, first examines the rolling window similarity between each pair of time
series over various lag lengths to determine the existence and strength of co-movements.
The lead / lag relationship is used next to build a directed graph to compute leadership score
and extract leaders.

We will use R to implement this methodology and present a case study on stocks in S&P 500 index
to validate predictive power and benefits of incorporation of lead / lag relationship discovery
in your investment process.
