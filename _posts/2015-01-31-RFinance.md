Publishing a Blog Post in 10 seconds

A blog post is a common way to share ideas within the R Finance community. 
Making a blog post is a creative process that takes time: one needs to write down ideas, 
create supporting charts & graphs, and finally publish the finished product on the web. 
Often, the last step, publishing a post - a not so creative process - takes a significant 
amount of time, for example, with Wordpress, a commonly used blogging platform.

GitHub Pages offers an exciting novel alternative that reduces the time dedicated to 
publishing a post from 10-20 minutes to 10 seconds. GitHub Pages are public webpages 
freely hosted and easily published through GitHub repository. It usually takes 
10 seconds or less to "commit" a Markdown post file and supporting charts. 
Once a "commit" is finished, GitHub's Automatic Page Generator handles all remaining 
steps in publishing a post: converts Markdown file into HTML webpage, embeds supporting 
graphics, and publishes the final result. The post is converted to a static webpage, 
hosted at GitHub servers and offers a super-fast load time.

Writing a post using RMarkdown syntax in RStudio is very productive: one can easily 
experiment, preview, spell check and debug. Once a post is ready, simple R script 
can convert RMarkdown file to a Markdown document, a format used by GitHub, and 
generate all supporting charts. Finally, the following script commits the post 
and it is automatically published by GitHub's Automatic Page Generator:

{% highlight r %}
git add .
git commit -m "update blog post"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

The Systematic Investor Blog migrated from Wordpress to GitHub Pages in January 2015. 
The main benefits of this migration: 

1. publishing a post takes only 10 seconds 
2. blog pages load 10 times faster [GitHub](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/#!/http://systematicinvestor.github.io/)
vs [Wordpress](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/#!/http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/)
3. [strategy](/strategy.html) pages are updated every night and automatically published

The presentation will show all steps required to create and run a blog at GitHub Pages 
using posts written in RMarkdown format.
