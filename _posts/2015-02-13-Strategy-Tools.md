Following is a collection of ideas / methods / tools to enhance investment strategy.
If you hit a block with an investment strategy development, give following techniques a try.

* [Adaptive Asset Allocation: A Primer by A. Butler, M. Philbrick, R. Gordillo 2012](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2328254)
This paper shows steps to improve strategy performance starting with
  * Equal Weight, next
  * Equal Volatility, next
  * Top Momentum, next
  * Top Momentum with Minimum Variance allocation
  * Target Risk

* The [Quantitative Approach To Tactical Asset Allocation Strategy(QATAA) by Mebane T. Faber](http://mebfaber.com/timing-model/)
please read [SSRN paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461) for more details
  * 10 month moving average go to cash filter

* [Averaged Input Assumptions and Momentum](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/averaged-input-assumptions-and-momentum/)
  * use multiple time-frames to average input assumptions

* [Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels-for-dummies/)
  * multi-system ensemble approach to combine and weight various strategies

* [Cluster Portfolio Allocation](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/cluster-portfolio-allocation/)
  * allocate within groups (clusters) first and next allocate across cluster

* [Dual Momentum](http://www.optimalmomentum.com/papers1.html)
  * similar to cluster approach with cash filter
  
* [Dynamic Asset Allocation](http://www.casact.org/cera/eppseminar/miccolis-reading2.pdf)
  * Adjust length of moving average based on the risk metric
  
* [Volatility-Adjusted Time Series](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/new-channel-concepts-volatility-adjusted-time-series/)
  * use risk-adjusted, normalized, time series to generate signal
  
* [Probabilistic Momentum](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/are-simple-momentum-strategies-too-dumb-introducing-probabilistic-momentum/)
  * convert metric into z-score, or percentile, - alot easier to work with percentile metric vs raw numbers
